# Why do I keep coming back to this?

> Agent Smith: "Why, Mr. Anderson? Why, why? Why do you do it? Why, why get up? 
> Why keep fighting? Do you believe you're fighting... for something? For more 
> than your survival? Can you tell me what it is? Do you even know? Is it freedom? 
> Or truth? Perhaps peace? Could it be for love? Illusions, Mr. Anderson. Vagaries
> of perception. Temporary constructs of a feeble human intellect trying desperately
> to justify an existence that is without meaning or purpose. And all of them as 
> artificial as the Matrix itself, although... only a human mind could invent 
> something as insipid as love. You must be able to see it, Mr. Anderson. You must 
> know it by now. You can't win. It's pointless to keep fighting. Why, Mr. Anderson?
> Why? Why do you persist?"

> Neo: "Because I choose to."

# What's different this time?

- Better UI/UX.
- More straightforward than my two previous attempts.
- Works for all your app's download buttons.

# Okay, fine. Show me.

Let's create a barebones shiny app with a download button in the UI and the
corresponding download handler in the server portion:

# Modify download handler

- on.exit
- send custom msg

# frontend

- add on click handler
- add custom msg handler
- add spinner
- disable btn

# Works for all download buttons

- add another download button & handler to app

# Even in modules!

- show module example
