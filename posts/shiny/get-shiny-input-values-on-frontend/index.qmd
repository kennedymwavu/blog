# Problem

You have a radio button group with two options:

- csv
- pdf

You also have an action button whose label you want to
change depending on the selected radio button option:

- "Download CSV", or,
- "Download PDF"

# Old way

young me would do it this way

# Better way

you already have everything on the frontend. use that!

- Shiny.shinyapp.$inputValues.input-value-id
