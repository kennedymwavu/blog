## Introduction

Your prod app should never have to fail, crash or display arcane red lines 
of errors on the UI. 

If it has to, it should do so gracefully and with dignity.
Only then will you have an easy time convincing the client that it's a 
six-legged feature, not a bug.

## When do errors arise?

Most, if not all, application errors occur when you're trying to perform an
operation on data. This can be during app startup or 
in response to user action.

Common cases are:

- Mathematical calculations eg. `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Data manipulations eg. subsetting (`iris[, "Sepal.Length"]`)

## Defensive programming

Defensive programming is an approach to software development that 
focuses on anticipating and preventing potential errors, bugs, and 
vulnerabilities in the code.

The fundamental concept of this approach is to develop a program that can function correctly even in the presence of unforeseen circumstances or when users enter unexpected inputs.

We'll focus on 2 key principles of defensive programming, both at the same time:

1. Validating inputs: Checking that all input values are within 
expected ranges or formats, and handling unexpected input values 
appropriately.

2. Handling errors: Catching and handling errors/exceptions in a way
that allows the program to recover gracefully, without crashing or 
losing data

That's where `tryCatch` comes in!

## tryCatch()

The basic syntax of `tryCatch()` is this:

::: {.callout-tip}
## Mental model:

Hey R,<br>
I have this block of code. I'm not sure if it's flawless, but I need you to try
and run it. <br>
In case you encounter issues, here's how you should proceed depending on the
scenario:

- Did it throw an error? Then do &lt;error handling&gt;
- Did it give a warning? Then run this &lt;warning handling chunk&gt;
- Finally, regardless of whether it ran successfully or failed, please
do &lt;finally block&gt;

## Hands-On

```r
library(shiny)
library(DT)

ui <- fluidPage(
  tags$div(
    class = "container",
    align = "center",
    selectInput(
      inputId = "cols",
      label = "Choose one or more columns",
      choices = c(names(iris), "Unknown Column"),
      multiple = TRUE
    ),
    DTOutput(outputId = "table")
  )
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$table <- renderDT({
    # iris[, input$cols]
    tryCatch(
      expr = {
        iris |> dplyr::select(input$cols)
      },
      error = \(e) {
        print("There's an error!")
      }
    )
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```
