## Demo

Here is how `renderUI()` normally functions:

![](normal-renderUI-demo.gif){alt="Normal renderUI demo"}

Notice how on the initial render, the user is just slapped with the content. It gets worse if you're rendering a huge portion.

Now let's take a look at a smooth render:

![](animated-renderUI-demo.gif){alt="Animated renderUI demo"}

Which one do you prefer?

If you like the normal rendering behaviour more than the animated one, it's okay. I totally understand your affinity to vanilla stuff. You can safely close this tab and go enjoy another ordinary day.

Are they gone? Alright. Fellow lovers of a shiny life and a good UX, let's get started.
