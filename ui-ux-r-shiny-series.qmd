## Why UI/UX is important

Sorry to burst your bubble but when building applications, it's NOT
about you. It's about your **users**. 

The sole purpose of creating an application is for it to be adopted by your **users**. 

&#8220; If people cannot understand how to use your application, or if your application front-end does not work at all, your application is not successful no matter how innovative and incredible the computation algorithms in the back-end are. &#8221; <br>--- [Engineering Production-Grade Shiny Apps](https://engineering-shiny.org/)
